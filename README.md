A summary and showcase of my master's thesis for my Quantum Technology program at San Jose State University (SJSU)

My thesis discusses the application of microwave engineering principles to superconducting chip design and simulation. This repository highlights my simulation milestones, research progress, and my overarching goal to mitigate noise and reliably implement single and two-qubit gates.

## Society of Quantum Engineers Guest Seminar

I presented my research progress at the SJSU Society of Quantum Engineers guest seminar in Fall 2024.
At this point in my research progress, I had my chip designed and taped-out. I also achieved some simulation milestones of performing eigenmode simulations to understand how different parts of my chip interact with different eigenfrequencies.

## National Science Foundation - NRT Annual Meeting 2024

In 2024, I was a recipient of the NSF funded Quantum Technology Traineeship titled "A Program for Training a Quantum Workforce NRT-QL". I had the opportunity to gain superb quantum engineering experience at the Colorado School of Mines and to present my NRT project at the NSF-NRT Annual Meeting 2024 in Washington, D.C.

## Quantum Many Body Physics Final Project - December 2024

As a part of the Phys 253 Quantum Many Body Physics course at SJSU, another student and I worked on a final project investigating a *Second Quantization Model of Coupled Transmon Qubits*, where we investigated the framework of the functionality of flux-tunable superconducting qubits, derived an analytical expression for the $iSWAP$ unitary, and considered a spacetime inspired model for describing multi-qubit interactions.

## Current Progress

At the moment, I am currently doing an investigative study into classical microwave components. In particular, I am learning about optimal design choices in coupled microwave electronics. Understanding classical coupling is an essential step to understanding the functionality of the quantum system as a whole.
