A summary and showcase of my master's thesis for my Quantum Technology program at San Jose State University

My thesis discusses the application of microwave engineering principles to superconducting chip design and simulation. This repository highlights my simulation milestones, research progress, and my overarching goal to mitigate noise and reliably implement single and two-qubit gates.
