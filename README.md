A summary and showcase of my master's thesis for my Quantum Technology program at San Jose State University (SJSU)

My thesis discusses the application of microwave engineering principles to superconducting chip design and simulation. This repository highlights my simulation milestones, research progress, and my overarching goal to mitigate noise and reliably implement single and two-qubit gates.

## Society of Quantum Engineers Guest Seminar

I presented my research progress at the SJSU Society of Quantum Engineers guest seminar in Fall 2024.
At this point in my research progress, I had my chip design and taped-out. I also achieved some simulation milestones of performing eigenmode simulations to understand how different parts of my chip interact with different eigenfrequencies
