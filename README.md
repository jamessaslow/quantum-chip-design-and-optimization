A summary and showcase of my master's thesis for my Quantum Technology program at San Jose State University

My research interests are in quantum foundations, quantum algorithms, and superconducting quantum hardware. In short, I am interested in all aspects of entanglement, from describing it at a fundamental level to physically realizing it in hardware.

My thesis discusses the application of microwave engineering principles to superconducting chip design and simulation. This repository highlights my simulation milestones, resaerch progress, and my overarching goal to mitigate noise and reliably implement single and two-qubit gates.
